#Image and Interaction 2D Project: Particules

_Author : Carton Floriane & De Sutter Florian_


Allows to approach some ingredients of graphic computing:

• Application of "Geometry / Algebra" (2D): vector, position, location, intersection.
• Application of "Mechanics" (of the point): speed, acceleration, force.
• "Algorithmic": representation and processing of 2D point lists.
